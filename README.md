# Project 05: 1st Integrated Project

**Objective:** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of video game sales data for Ice, an online, worldwide video game store, to assist stakeholders with predicting the most successful video game releases for the upcoming calendar year.

**Accomplishments:** I found the variations in global video game sales between contemporary platforms, determined if reviews from users and/or critics correlate with total sales, investigated if games released on multiple platforms sell equally well on each platform or not, and compared the distributions of sales between various video game genres. I also created profiles for North America, Europe, and Japan that indicate the top 5 best selling video game platforms and genres in each region. Lastly, I used two-tailed t-tests (with a 95% confidence interval) to compare user ratings between Xbox and PC games and also user ratings between Action and Sports games.
 
**Skills Demonstrated:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, profile creation, hypothesis testing, and consumer insight generation
